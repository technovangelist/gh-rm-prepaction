# gh-rm-prepaction

If you are using README.io to host documentation, you know that it's an awkward workflow. They push the UI but it's hard to make comments on content, and if you update a document, are you clobbering someone else's work? Well, it's hard to know. So you can host your docs in GitHub and use their rdme tool to sync. But rdme is missing a lot of features, and it requires a bunch of metadata in the form of frontmatter that is going to be ugly when viewed from GitHub. And rdme doesn't care if you have your md docs in folders; unless you specify the category and parent of the file, it's going to sit at the root. Wait, no, if you don't specify the category, it won't sync. And of course you can't just use the name of the category, you have to have the ID. And the ID isn't available except from the API.

Ugh. So this GitHub action will take in a docs folder name and then parse all the files under there. The folders that your files will determine the category and if deep enough, also the parentDoc will be populated. All you need to have in your markdown is an H1 title on the first line. The rest is magically generated for you based on the location of the file.
